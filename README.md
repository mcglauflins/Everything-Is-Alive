# Everything-Is-Alive
Concept Idea:
  - Game is about Tim the Tomato. The game starts out happy, the veggies are being chosen from the fridge, then placed on the counter butcher block. Smiles and ahppy music, then the knife cuts the first veggie, the veggies freak out and are screaming, only one is able to escape. Tim. Tim's goal is to jump, dash, and plop through the kitchen to safety.
  - Potential 3 levels, see how this will go as we start moving along.
  - Game ends with bright light through cracked door, only for Baylor (my dog) design TBD, to look up and snatch the tomato and eat Tim.

# Level 1
- Getting away from the cutting board and over the sink. Can be killed by killer garbage disposal. Easy Level, minimal jumping and dashing (potential movement) Level cleared and screen for new level.
 [potential save if applicable]

# Level 2
- the crusher level. Goal of this is to get away from "alive" evil kitchen utensils, whose soul purpose is to serve the master (aka the cook) hop and Roll your way through obstacles in order to cause power outage for intro into level 3
  [potential save if applicable]

# Level 3
- Dark level. Limited visibility. Roll your way through obtacles with visible lighting, jumping and potential dashing to the light source from the cracked door. This level will have a vengeful veggie tbd that is behind Tim that can take his place if he fails. Finish the game by jumping off the counter and out the door. The light is bright, blue skies, and happy music. Only for Tomato to roll into Baylor and get eaten.
- POTENTIAL HAPPY ENDING: Tim rolls and jumps his way through a cracked window and falls into the garden, where a magical being transforms him into a flourishing tomato plant. Tim is happy.
